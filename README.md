Resonant Gravity Framework (Erwin 2026)
======================================

Author:
    Erwin Ali Murijal (Indonesia)

Purpose:
    This framework proposes a resonance-based interpretation of
    gravitational orbital structure using a discrete phase constant.
    The model is phenomenological and intended for empirical testing,
    not as a replacement for General Relativity or Quantum Mechanics.


------------------------------------------------------------
1. CORE IDEA
------------------------------------------------------------

Gravity is treated as an organizing interaction that drives matter
toward discrete equilibrium phases.

Orbital stability emerges when matter aligns with specific
gravitational resonance phases.

Space is assumed to be absolute.
Time is treated as a consequence of material transitions from
superposition to realized configuration.


------------------------------------------------------------
2. FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANT
------------------------------------------------------------

A universal phase constant is introduced:

    K36 = 36 degrees = π / 5 radians

K36 acts as a discrete gravitational phase quantum,
analogous to π in geometry but applied to orbital phase structure.

K36 is:
- dimensionless
- independent of mass, distance, and time
- empirically motivated by orbital spacing patterns


------------------------------------------------------------
3. RESONANT ORBIT MODEL
------------------------------------------------------------

Stable orbital radii follow an exponential resonance law:

    r_n = r_0 · exp( α · n · K36 )

Where:
    r_n  = orbital radius at phase index n
    r_0  = reference radius of the innermost stable orbit
    α    = system-dependent scaling parameter
    n    = integer resonance index (n = 0, 1, 2, ...)
    K36  = π / 5

The parameter α is not assumed,
but inferred from observed orbital data.


------------------------------------------------------------
4. INTERPRETATION
------------------------------------------------------------

• Gravity does not "force" matter into orbit,
  but provides a resonance landscape.

• Matter naturally accumulates at phase-aligned minima
  of gravitational resonance.

• Regions that do not align with K36 phases
  cannot form stable satellites and may remain as rings
  or diffuse material.


------------------------------------------------------------
5. SCOPE OF APPLICATION
------------------------------------------------------------

The framework is intended to be applied to:

- Planetary systems
- Satellite systems
- Ring systems
- Exoplanetary systems
- Multi-body gravitational hierarchies

It is not restricted to the Solar System.


------------------------------------------------------------
6. RELATION TO EXISTING THEORIES
------------------------------------------------------------

• Does not replace Newtonian gravity or General Relativity
• Does not modify Einstein field equations
• Acts as a structural / organizational layer
  on top of classical gravity

The framework is compatible with empirical testing
and falsification.


------------------------------------------------------------
7. CURRENT STATUS
------------------------------------------------------------

Theoretical development is intentionally paused.

Next steps focus on:
- observational testing
- statistical validation
- cross-system comparison

No technological or propulsion claims are made.
