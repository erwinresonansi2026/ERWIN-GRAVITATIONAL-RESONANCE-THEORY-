# ERWIN-GRAVITATIONAL-RESONANCE-THEORY-
Universal Mechanics: The Gravitational Resonance Theory

Authored by: Erwin Ali Murijal Origin: Pati, Central Java, Indonesia

1. Abstract This repository/post presents a fundamental shift in universal mechanics, authored by Erwin Ali Murijal from Pati, Indonesia. The core premise is that gravity is a dynamic determinism mechanism that governs the state-transition of matter from quantum uncertainty (superposition) to physical certainty (definite position).

2. Gravitational Determinism and Wave-Function Collapse The fundamental conflict between Quantum Mechanics (QM) and General Relativity (GR) is resolved by identifying gravity as the "External Signal" responsible for the non-random collapse of the wave function.Deterministic Finality: Gravity dictates the Finality Vector—the specific direction where a particle ends its uncertainty.Without this gravitational resonance, matter would remain in a permanent state of superposition.

3. The Mechanism of Resonance Interaksi antar massa dipahami sebagai Resonansi Sinkron. Setiap struktur atom memiliki frekuensi bawaan, dan gravitasi bertindak sebagai frekuensi utama yang menyelaraskan awan probabilitas menjadi lintasan fisik yang pasti.

4. Conclusion As the originator of this theory, Erwin Ali Murijal proposes that gravity is the final stage of quantum evolution. It is the mechanism that defines the "Final State" for allmatter in the universe.
