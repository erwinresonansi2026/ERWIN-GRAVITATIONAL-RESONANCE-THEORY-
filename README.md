# Resonance-Based Physics & Mechanics of Balancing Tendencies (MBT)

> An open conceptual framework exploring resonance, time regimes, and non-geometric foundations of physical stability.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents a developing theoretical framework that re-examines fundamental assumptions in physics—particularly **time, gravity, stability, and interaction**—through the lens of **resonance and tendential balancing**, rather than spacetime curvature alone.

The framework is **exploratory and open-source in spirit**.  
It is not presented as a final theory, but as a **conceptual bridge** intended to clarify, reorganize, and potentially connect ideas between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.

## 🧠 Core Concepts (English)

### 1. Resonance-Based Physics (Erwin Resonance)

- The universe is governed primarily by **phase alignment (resonance)** between material systems.
- **Space** is treated as structural/absolute.
- **Time** is not fundamental; it emerges from the **rate of material change**.
- Gravity is **not a fundamental force**, but a collective effect of phase alignment through a **passive latent medium**.
- This medium does not carry information; it only mediates coherence (tentatively associated with dark matter).
- Natural systems tend toward configurations of **minimal phase conflict**, not merely minimal energy.
- Non-hierarchical three-body systems are inherently unstable.
- Horizons (e.g., black holes) are interpreted as **epistemic limits**, not locations where time literally stops.

### 2. Harmonic Phase Constant: K36 (36° / π/5)

- A universal **harmonic phase unit** associated with stable orbits and configurations.
- Stability emerges when system phases approach integer multiples of K36.
- Treated as a **geometric phase ratio**, not an imposed numerical constant.

---

### 3. Super-Temporal Regimes (Revision of “Pre-Time Matter”)

- Matter previously described as “pre-time” is reinterpreted as operating in a **super-temporal regime**:
  - It possesses internal time, but at a rate vastly faster than that of the observer.
- Apparent instantaneous interactions are explained as **resolution limits of observer time**.
- Light has **no internal time**; its speed is always parameterized by the observer.
- The speed of light represents a **boundary between temporal regimes**, not merely a spatial limit.

---

### 4. Light and Photons

- Photons are **pure momentum carriers**, not massive matter.
- Forces from intense light arise from **momentum transfer**, not accumulated mass.
- Light exists at the **temporal boundary condition** of physical regimes.

---

### 5. Black Holes (Symmetric Interpretation)

- Black holes are not absolute physical singularities.
- They represent:
  - Extreme **time dilation** from an external observer’s perspective.
  - A symmetric counterpart to extreme **time acceleration** regimes.
- Matter that is resonantly misaligned is redistributed into a **base passive medium**.

---

### 6. Mechanics of Balancing Tendencies (MBT)

A general framework describing how material systems evolve across scales.

**Axioms**
1. Material systems obey given base rules (origins not addressed).
2. High internal conflict is unsustainable.
3. Interactions trigger reconfiguration toward lower internal conflict.
4. Stability is dynamic and cyclical.
5. No teleology or final goal is assumed.

**Fourth Property: Tendential Hysteresis**
- Systems never return to identical states.
- Each cycle leaves structural traces.
- This provides a **direction of time without metaphysical assumptions**.

---

### 7. Philosophical & Ethical Position

- This framework is **not a claim of final truth**.
- It is intended as:
  - A conceptual clarification tool
  - A bridge between incompatible formalisms
- High misuse potential is acknowledged; ethical restraint is emphasized.
- Even if incomplete, the framework aims to leave **conceptual DNA** for future theories.

## 🇮🇩 Ringkasan Inti (Bahasa Indonesia)

### Gambaran Umum

Repositori ini mendokumentasikan kerangka teori eksploratif yang meninjau ulang asumsi dasar fisika—khususnya **waktu, gravitasi, dan kestabilan sistem**—melalui pendekatan **resonansi dan keseimbangan tendensi**, bukan kelengkungan ruang semata.

Teori ini bersifat **terbuka dan non-final**, dimaksudkan sebagai alat penjernih konseptual dan jembatan antara Relativitas Umum dan Mekanika Kuantum.

### Poin Utama

- Alam diatur oleh **penyelarasan fase**, bukan gaya fundamental semata.
- Waktu bukan entitas dasar, melainkan konsekuensi perubahan materi.
- Gravitasi adalah efek kolektif resonansi melalui medium pasif.
- Cahaya berada pada batas rezim waktu.
- Lubang hitam adalah batas epistemik, bukan singularitas absolut.
- MBT menjelaskan dinamika alam sebagai rekonfigurasi menuju konflik internal yang lebih rendah.
- Arah waktu muncul dari **histeresis tendensial**, bukan asumsi metafisik.

The goal is not permanence, but usefulness.”*

Falsification Postulate (MBT-F):
The existence of a well-maintained material system that maintains high internal conflict in a stable and continuous manner, without reconfiguration or dissipation across scales,
is a condition that refutes the Balancing Tendency Mechanics framework.
